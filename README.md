## Installation

1. **Install Node**: Install the correct version of node (v22.15.0) for the project.

> ### Note About Node
>
> If you are using [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you can run:
>
> ```sh

> ```

Run the follow command to make sure that you are on the correct version of node:

```sh
node -v # Should be v22.15.0
```

2. **Install Node Dependencies**: Install all the dependencies that the project uses by running the following command in the project's root directory:
